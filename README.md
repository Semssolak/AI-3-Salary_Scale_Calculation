# AI3-Salary_Scale_Calculation

## Polynomial Regression Model

This project demonstrates a Polynomial Regression model using a dataset related to experience and salary. The model is built using Python with the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` libraries. The dataset includes information on years of experience and corresponding salary.

## Project Structure

- `polynomial.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `polynomial_regression.py`: Python script implementing the model.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the project and instructions for use.

## Dataset

The dataset (`polynomial.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `Experience`: Years of work experience
- `Salary`: Salary corresponding to the experience (in local currency)

Example data:

| Experience | Salary  |
|------------|---------|
| 1          | 4500    |
| 2          | 5000    |
| 3          | 6000    |
| 4          | 8000    |
| 5          | 11000   |
